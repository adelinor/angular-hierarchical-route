	This is a sample application to illustrate the use
	of routing in the truly heroic <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>
	framework.
	To give this app a neat look, the great
	<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">CSS Bootstrap</a> is used.
</p>
<p>
	This sample has three main routes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>/about</strong></strong>: this page's content
		is static</li>
		<li><strong>/admin</strong></strong>: this is a page to
		expand the list of predefined cities</li>
		<li><strong>/home</strong></strong>: this allows a user
		to select a location<strong>*</strong>. The
		current weather then shows for the selected location. A user can from
		there navigate to the next 48 hours forecast.
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>[*]</strong>: a location is selected by choosing first a country. This then
		brings the list of cities for that country in a second drop down.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	This HTML layout is a modified version of the CSS Bootstrap example
	<code>Stick footer with fixed navbar</code>
</p>
